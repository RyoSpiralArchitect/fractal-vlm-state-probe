# Roadmap

## Phase 0: Reproducible Stimuli

- Deterministic Mandelbrot and Julia streams.
- Manifest validation with hashes and timestamps.
- External frame manifests for natural and geometric controls.
- Condition metadata for comparison axes.

Status: scaffolded.

## Phase 1: MLX-VLM Stream Probe

- Frame-by-frame chat streaming.
- Isolated before/mid/after probes.
- Sampled KV-cache summaries.
- Honest run metadata and non-claims.

Status: scaffolded.

## Phase 2: Hugging Face Internal Trace

- `model_id` and `local_path` loading.
- Hidden-state extraction via supported model outputs or hooks.
- Token/logit metrics for probe prompts.
- Matched output schema with MLX runs.

Status: first adapter scaffolded. Model-specific hooks and broader compatibility
passes are next.

## Phase 3: Remote Logprob Adapters

- Provider capability probes.
- OpenAI/Google/xAI adapter boundaries.
- Forced-choice and open-ended logprob probes.
- Behavior-only fallback labeling.

Status: planned.

## Phase 4: Comparison Runs

Run matched conditions inside the same model:

- blank visual null,
- Mandelbrot ordered,
- Mandelbrot shuffled,
- Julia ordered,
- non-fractal geometry,
- natural city/street,
- natural animal,
- deterministic noise.

Status: design-ready after Phase 2/3 adapters.

## Phase 4.5: Trace Separability

- Extract cache-summary feature matrices from completed runs.
- Run simple condition classifiers such as nearest centroid, kNN, or logistic
  regression.
- Report duplicate seeds and deterministic repeat caveats explicitly.
- Use classifiers to decide which visual controls deserve deeper raw-trace
  instrumentation.

Status: first nearest-centroid cache-summary classifier implemented.

## Phase 4.6: Low-Level Visual Controls

- Static repeat, shuffled order, reversed order.
- Phase-scrambled Mandelbrot and Julia.
- Voronoi, tiling, checkerboard, quasicrystal, random dot, blue-noise, and
  white-noise generators.
- Histogram-matched visual controls.
- Feature extraction for image statistics such as brightness, contrast, edge
  density, spectrum, entropy, periodicity, and symmetry.

Status: first generator suite implemented. Histogram matching and image-statistic
reports are next.

## Phase 5: Research Report

- Analysis notebook or script.
- Tables for condition metadata and run capabilities.
- Probe output diffs.
- Logprob/trace plots.
- Strict separation between observed effects and interpretation.

Status: future.
