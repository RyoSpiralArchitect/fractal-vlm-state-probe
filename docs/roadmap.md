# Roadmap

## Phase 0: Reproducible Stimuli

- Deterministic Mandelbrot and Julia streams.
- Manifest validation with hashes and timestamps.
- External frame manifests for natural and geometric controls.
- Condition metadata for comparison axes.

Status: scaffolded.

## Phase 1: MLX-VLM Stream Probe

- Frame-by-frame chat streaming.
- Isolated before/mid/after probes.
- Sampled KV-cache summaries.
- Honest run metadata and non-claims.

Status: scaffolded.

## Phase 2: Hugging Face Internal Trace

- `model_id` and `local_path` loading.
- Hidden-state extraction via supported model outputs or hooks.
- Token/logit metrics for probe prompts.
- Matched output schema with MLX runs.

Status: first adapter scaffolded. Model-specific hooks and broader compatibility
passes are next.

## Phase 3: Remote Logprob Adapters

- Provider capability probes.
- OpenAI/Google/xAI adapter boundaries.
- Forced-choice and open-ended logprob probes.
- Behavior-only fallback labeling.

Status: planned.

## Phase 4: Comparison Runs

Run matched conditions inside the same model:

- blank visual null,
- Mandelbrot ordered,
- Mandelbrot shuffled,
- Julia ordered,
- non-fractal geometry,
- natural city/street,
- natural animal,
- deterministic noise.

Status: design-ready after Phase 2/3 adapters.

## Phase 4.5: Trace Separability

- Extract cache-summary feature matrices from completed runs.
- Run simple condition classifiers such as nearest centroid, kNN, or logistic
  regression.
- Report duplicate seeds and deterministic repeat caveats explicitly.
- Use classifiers to decide which visual controls deserve deeper raw-trace
  instrumentation.

Status: first nearest-centroid cache-summary classifier implemented.

## Phase 4.55: Paired Stochastic Probes

- Keep stream generation deterministic while sampling probes.
- Apply matched probe seed series across conditions.
- Compare `mid` and `after` distributions after subtracting `before` variance.
- Start with lexical distance, then add embeddings, semantic word categories,
  and cache-summary classifier reads on the same runs.

Status: first MLX batch runner and lexical summary implemented.

## Phase 4.6: Low-Level Visual Controls

- Static repeat, shuffled order, reversed order.
- Phase-scrambled Mandelbrot and Julia.
- RGB-quantile and luminance-rank matched phase-scrambled Mandelbrot and Julia.
- Low-pass and high-pass frequency ablations, including luminance-rank matched
  variants.
- Arbitrary manifest batch runner for transformed-control sweeps.
- Voronoi, tiling, checkerboard, quasicrystal, random dot, blue-noise, and
  white-noise generators.
- Histogram-matched visual controls.
- Cross-family palette controls that preserve one manifest's exact frame-level
  RGB pixel multiset while using another manifest's luminance-rank spatial
  ordering.
- Feature extraction for image statistics such as brightness, contrast, edge
  density, spectrum, entropy, periodicity, and symmetry.
- Processor-space image statistics computed after `pixel_values` conversion,
  including architecture-aware cycles-per-patch spectral summaries.
- Raw and processor-space 2x2 factorial image-stat contrasts aligned with the
  cache-summary factorial contrast.
- Replicated cross-palette factorial preparation over multiple source pairs.
- MLX first-step top-k and complete-vocabulary readout capture with saved-run
  contrast analysis.

Status: the generator, transformed-control, external-manifest, raw image-stat,
processor-stat, 2x2 factorial, and arbitrary manifest-batch paths are
implemented. Cross-palette transfer is replicated over two source pairs and
shows pair-dependent non-additive input/processor interactions. Complete
first-step vocabulary capture and KL/JS/TV/Hellinger plus probability-space
factorial analysis are now implemented. Earlier persistent-cache and branched
top-k interpretations were withdrawn by the Note 0027 prefix audit; the input
and processor-space findings remain valid.

## Phase 4.65: Targeted Cache Interventions

- Exact source/donor multimodal prefix and cache sequence-length checks.
- Single-layer values swaps with reciprocal branches.
- Matched source-with-source sham branches.
- Multi-layer and multi-seed sweep runner with saved top-k readouts.
- Token edit distance, top-k RMSE, and normalized donor/source pull analysis.
- Dense layer, key/value, layer-window, and sequence-position intervention
  scans.

Status: historical values-swap scaffolds and runs exist, but the Note 0027
audit found that their image-conditioned branch did not preserve the required
multimodal prefix/cache-length relation. All layer-23 and layers-10-13 causal
or susceptibility claims are withdrawn. This phase is blocked on a rebuilt
multimodal suffix path that fails closed unless exact prefix, cache length,
tensor shape, and token-region invariants pass. Reciprocal directions,
self-sham branches, full-vocabulary scoring, keys/values, layer windows, and
position-local swaps remain required after that path is valid.

## Phase 4.7: Cross-Model Replication

- Reuse the same manifests, factorial formulas, and readout contracts across
  distinct local VLM architectures.
- Record runtime versions and validate cache summaries for finite values.
- Separate stateless/single-frame, cumulative-replay, and incremental-cache
  protocols explicitly.
- Compare loci by normalized depth and token region rather than raw layer or
  position number alone.

Status: the balanced one-frame direct core now covers SmolVLM2, Qwen2.5-VL,
Gemma 3, InternVL3, LFM2-VL, Phi-3.5 Vision, Granite Vision, and Ministral 3 over
four source pairs. A two-model eight-panel control extension adds two
independent fractal pairs and matched frequency, geometry, noise, and natural
controls. The wider valid direct surface contains 62 factorial points, 248 cell
runs, and 992 complete-vocabulary sidecars, with non-identical after-cell
distributions in every factorial. Ministral adds a four-pair `keys`-component
scalar profile whose exact layer and sign vary. Its 16 selected full-vector
targets are spatial/palette/interaction-dominant in 15/1/0 and all interaction
maxima are image-localized. The total selected full-vector surface contains 176
layer-by-pair analyses; 164 have resolved token partitions, including 164/164
zero pre-image effects and 160/164 image-position interaction maxima. Late
post-image directions remain aligned over six fractal pairs in Qwen/Granite and
collapse over their six controls; Ministral repeats weaker post-image alignment
over the original four fractal pairs at layers 1, 16, and 25. Phi's 12 analyses
remain role-unassigned. The eight-model prompt audit is balanced over all four
pairs. Generated patterns agree over every pair in 39/64 fixed records,
balanced-axis dominance in 4/64, and both in 2/64. The next independent-evidence
step is multiple seeded pairs inside each control class plus source-level
permutation references before extending nested lengths.

## Phase 5: Research Report

- Analysis notebook or script.
- Tables for condition metadata and run capabilities.
- Probe output diffs.
- Logprob/trace plots.
- Strict separation between observed effects and interpretation.

Status: the evidence matrix and Notes 0027-0038 encode the audited claim
boundary, balanced eight-model direct and prompt replication, selected
full-vector localization, scalar-locus versus vector-direction separation, and
the source-class-conditional direction result. Initial manuscript tables exist;
calibrated nulls and figures remain future work. The current priority is
within-class source replication and permutation calibration, a neutral
wording/order/verbalizer factorial, Phi coordinate resolution, a distinct
ninth-architecture replication, Ministral head/position-resolved vector
analysis, and a valid intervention path before causal prose is promoted.
